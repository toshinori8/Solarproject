# Solar System Comparison Tool

A comprehensive web application for comparing different solar system configurations, built with Node.js and modern web technologies. This tool helps users make informed decisions about solar panel installations by providing detailed analysis of various configurations.

## üåü Features

### Solar System Analysis
- Calculate and compare solar panel systems based on panel count and battery configurations
- Analyze return on investment (ROI) for different setups
- Visualize energy production vs. consumption with interactive charts
- Input and save location-specific solar production data via PVGIS integration
- Explore scenarios for winter and summer energy production
- Track and compare energy independence with different configurations

### Technical Capabilities
- Real-time calculations and updates
- Server-side API handling for reliable data fetching
- Configuration saving and loading functionality
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Interactive tooltips with detailed explanations
- Beautiful SVG animations

### Data Analysis
- Detailed ROI calculations
- Energy production forecasting
- Battery capacity optimization
- Seasonal performance analysis
- Cost-benefit comparisons

## üìä Calculation Methods

### Production Calculations
- **Annual Production**: `panels √ó panel_power √ó annual_production_factor`
- **Winter Daily**: `panels √ó panel_power √ó winter_production_factor`
- **Summer Daily**: `panels √ó panel_power √ó summer_production_factor`

### Battery Analysis
- **Usable Capacity**: `batteries √ó battery_capacity √ó depth_of_discharge`
- **Daily Coverage**: `(usable_capacity / daily_consumption) √ó 100%`

### Financial Metrics
- **Total Cost**: `(panels √ó panel_price) + (batteries √ó battery_price) + inverter_price + additional_costs`
- **Annual Savings**: `(solar_production √ó grid_price) + (battery_capacity √ó night_savings √ó 365)`
- **Payback Period**: `total_cost / annual_savings`
- **5-Year ROI**: `((annual_savings √ó 5 - total_cost) / total_cost) √ó 100%`
